# Texture Experiment
A WebGL experiment based on Three.js and some Shaders. I try to reproduce the case study ["Find Your Way To OZ"](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/casestudies/oz/?redirect_from_locale=fr) in order to learn how to use texture as noise. Here, the wind is simulated by the perlin noise.

Demo available [here](http://mathis-biabiany.fr/lab/texturenoise/).

#### Technologies :
* ThreeJs
* GLSL

#### Setup from the [boilerplate](https://github.com/vdaguenet/threejs-starter-kit) of [vdaguenet](https://github.com/vdaguenet)  :
After cloning install all node dependencies and libraries :  
```shell
npm i
npm start
```

#### If you want to deploy  :
```shell
npm run build
```

Enjoy !
